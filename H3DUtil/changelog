if NULL was added to the vector .
- Fixed a bug that could result in thread locking when a PeriodicThread was 
destructed.
- Updates to compile with gcc 4.5.
- Fixed bug that could cause a problem when deallocating PixelImage instances
created by the loadNrrdFile.
- Fixed a bug that could result in callbacks not being removed from 
removeAsynchronousCallback and clearAllCallbacks.
- Added nrPixelComponents and convertToNormalizedData function to Image class.
- Fixed a bug for size_t being unsigned.

Changes for version 1.1.1:

- Updates to compile with gcc 3.1.1 on Ubuntu 9.10 and Visual Studio 2010.
- CMake build updates. Variables that points to include directories and
libraries are now grouped together for each external library.

- Added support to read paletted image types with FreeImage.

Changes for version 1.1:

- Default rotation axis for Rotation is now 1 0 0 as it should be.
- Added insert and erase methods to AutoRefVector.
- Cmake build system updates, such as explicity listing all files belonging to
the H3DUtil project.
- Fixed bugs reported on www.h3d.org.
- Various important fixes to image classes.
- Additional LoadImageFunctions in order to load DICOM and nrrd images.
- Added Priority enumerator for defining thread priority. The values of the
enumerator used instead of system dependent thread priority definitions.
- Added mechanisms for thread safe Console output.
- Fixes to compile on 64 bit Windows.
- Fixes to compile on recent versions of gcc.
- Documentation updates.

New source files:
 - ReadWriteH3DTypes.h - Contains functions that can be used to write and read
 H3DTypes as binary data to and from a stream.
 - DicomImage.h, DicomImage.cpp. Contains an image loaded from dicom files.


Changes for version 1.0:

- Corrections to CMake build system and additions for compiling against static
 libraries.
- Doxygen updates.
- Fixes in PixelImage and LoadImageFunctions.
- Fixes concerning thread handling.
- Fixed bugs reported on www.h3d.org.

New Classes:
Quaterniond - A double version of Quaternion.
Rotationd - A double version of Rotation.



Changes for version 1.0 beta 1:

- Memory leak fixes.
- The function asynchronousCallback in PeriodicThreadBase returns a handle that
can be used as argument to the new function removeAsynchronousCallback.
- Fixed a lot of minor bugs. See svn changelog at www.h3d.org:8080 for details.
- Added ExtremaFindingAlgorithms which is a collection of algorithms that finds
extrema. Currently only contains an implementation of amoeba.


New Classes and related functions:
Image - class moved here from H3D API.
FreeImageImage - class moved here from H3D API.
LoadImageFunctions - moved functions here. They are used to read image files.
PixelImage - class moved here for H3D API.

Compability issues:
- Header files moved to include/H3DUtil. Include them with H3DUtil/ prefix.
